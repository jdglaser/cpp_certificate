**Discussion**

IRQs are interrupt requests that come from devices to the CPU. When a device souch as a sound car, keyboard, or disk drive needs to do something, it sends an IRQ to the CPU. The CPU then does the required action based on the priority of the device requesting the interrupt.

To make interrupt handlers more flexible, several devices may share the same IRQ line. This functionality can be handled in two ways. The first is IRQ sharing where the interrupt handler executes multiple interrupt service routines assigned to the IRQ to determine which device needs attention. The second is dynamic allocation where the device driver is only assigned to an IRQ line only at the moment the device is needed.

An example of the interrupt process can be seen below:

**Lab Results**

The lab was a good way to see the interrupts on my system. It was 
interesting to use the `watch` command to see the interrupts happening in real time.

```
cat /proc/interrupts
```

From the above output, my system had `181,821` interrupts.

I did not see any IRQ specific information in the above output, but it was interesting to see the Virtual Box information, which is the virtual computer software I am using to run Linux.

One useful IRQ utility tool is View -> Resources by connection in Device Manager in Windows operating systems.

**Response**

Hi James,

Thanks for sharing this information on subshells. I had not heard about subshells before so this is really helpful.

I find it really useful that we can take advantage of multi-threaded execution in bash. I also like your use of the `fortune` command in bash. I didn't know that existed either!
